<p>Omnisciently Selective Singles</p>
<p>If you are 20 to 24 years old, heterosexual, single, and selective in an almost omniscient sense, this website is for you.</p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>My name is Omar Mahfouz. This is my real name and it has been since the day I was born. I was born on August 2 2003 in Los Angeles, California. I am a heterosexual male and I am a practicing Muslim of Egyptian origin. As of August 2025, I am single and I have never dated, got engaged to, or married anyone before. I am currently based in Southern California.</p>
<p>Why do I not have a photo or video of myself?</p>
<p>Because I want to make this website as light as possible so it loads fast on any device.</p>
<p>Is this a dating website?</p>
<p>While this website is similar to selective dating websites, this website is most accurately described as a website explicitly for lifelong relationships of any kind, whether it be business, platonic, or romantic (in other words, a lifelong relationships website). Notice that I said "lifelong" instead of "serious". Not all serious relationships last for life, and from my personal experience, I never once heard someone say that they want lifelong relationships. This website is for people who are willing to explicitly tell strangers that they want lifelong relationships on the very first day they meet them.</p>
<p>What kind of people is this website for?</p>
<p>This website is for heterosexual singles aged 20 to 24 who are so selective that they would get to know someone for at least 100 full years before deciding to marry them, assuming that life expectancy was long enough to allow that. If you do not want to get married and/or you reject monogamy altogether, then this website is also for people who are looking for lifelong relationships from day one, even if they are only business relationships. People who do not have any close nonfamilial friends or prior romantic partners are ideal candidates.
100 years is far too small of a number to describe unimaginable selectivity, so I will stretch your imagination to its ultimate limit. A number like Graham's number is so large that the entire universe cannot contain it. Numbers like TREE(3) far exceed Graham's number. But since the race to create the biggest number continues, I will create my own thought experiment. Imagine a number D. I define D as the largest conceived number by infinite immortal mathematicians. D is the limit of collective infinite human thought over infinite time. Imagine a number E. E makes D look like zero (D/E=1/infinity). E is so big that it will never be conceived by infinite immortal humans, even implicitly. Imagine a number F. F makes E look like zero (E/F=1/infinity). F will also never be conceived. Imagine your circle being of the size E and being chosen from a pool of F people. In such a scenario, you are almost omnisciently selective and you want a truly unquantifiable social circle. If you metaphorically operate on a scale that big, then you truly are a big thinker. I know that this description is impossible and frankly, hilarious, but think about it. If you crave stimulation to the point when you think that even skydiving is too easy, you would want the most stimulating social life possible, and this website is my answer for you.</p>
<p>Is this website free?</p>
<p>Yes. This website is 100% free. I will not charge anyone for anything. After all, I made this website for free.</p>
<p>What is my plan to get people to meet in person?</p>
<p>If you want to join a video call with other people you can meet in person, you can send me an email via omar.mahfouz@gmail.com and I will invite you to a video call on the website of your choice. And because this website is so light, you can download it and share it offline with virtually anyone. I made this website as scalable as possible.</p>
