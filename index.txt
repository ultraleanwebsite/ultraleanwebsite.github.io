Omnisciently Selective Singles-This website is for heterosexual singles aged 20 to 24 who are so selective that they would literally get to know someone for at least 100 full years before deciding to marry them, assuming that life expectancy was long enough to allow that. Of course, not everyone wants to get married in the future, so this website is also for people who are looking for any kind of lifelong relationships. You can email me via omar.mahfouz@gmail.com. This website is 100% free.
